## PROBLEM STATEMENT

As Indiaâ€™s electric vehicle (EV) market accelerates, AtliQ Motors faces crucial decisions to secure a competitive edge, ranging from state-specific adoption rates to optimal manufacturing locations and marketing strategies. To better position itself in this evolving industry, AtliQ Motors needs comprehensive insights into market leaders, regional penetration rates, seasonal sales trends, and factors influencing customer preferences for EVs. Additionally, the company seeks to determine ideal locations for manufacturing based on state incentives and infrastructure, alongside strategic recommendations for product pricing, brand ambassadors, and promotional campaigns.





#### PROBLEM OVERVIEW

This project involves a detailed analysis of India's EV market from 2022 to 2024, focusing on the performance of 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler segments across different states. By examining data on sales volumes, regional penetration rates, compounded growth rates, and quarterly trends, we aim to uncover critical insights on high-growth states, seasonal demand patterns, and comparative state adoption rates. Secondary research explores factors like customer preferences, government subsidies, and charging infrastructure, with recommendations for strategic actions. The insights and findings from this analysis will support AtliQ Motors in making data-driven decisions for product development, manufacturing location, and targeted marketing approaches.
